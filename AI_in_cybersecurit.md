# AI in cybersecurity
## core Concepts

### Role of AL/ML in Cybersecurity

- Machine Learning for intrusion detection and malware analysis
- Predictive analytics for attack prevention
- AL-driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

### AI Techniques in Security
- Supervised learning: Malware classification (Benign vs Malicious)
- Unsupervised learning : Anomaly detection in logs
- Reinforcement learning: Adaptive respose system

### Application of AI in Threat Detection
- Email phishing detection using NLP
- Behavior-based endpoint protection
- Network traffic anamaly detection (IDS/IPS enhancement)
- User and Enitity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

### AI-powered Tools & Platforms
- IBM Qradar Advisor with Watson
- Darktrace(AI for network anamaly detection)
- CrowdStrike Falcon (AI endpoint protection)
- CylancePROTECT, Azure sbtinel(ML-based alerts)

  ### Limitations & Ethical Challenges
- Adversarial ML (poisoning data, evasion attacks)
- Privacy conecrns (traning data exposure)
- Explainability issues (AI decision transparency)
